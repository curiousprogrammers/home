    <p>Curious Programmers, a coding platform for children between ages 8 to 24 years. They learn aspects of coding through a gamification process, which ensures we bring in an element of fun in learning. We introduce  computer programming languages like Python, JavaScript and HTML in a way that is not too daunting for the young minds to grasp</p>

            We at Curious Programmers have made it a pursuit to not only engage in analytical thinking but aim to draw attention to the softer, interpersonal traits too. We encourage students to partake in the coding process with attention to life skills such as showing respect, being empathetic and helping each other succeed. Lessons of caring, happiness, teamwork and self-exploration are important offshoots in this process of learning.
